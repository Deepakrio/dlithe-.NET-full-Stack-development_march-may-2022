           <h1>Why Home Schooling?</h1> 

            1. We Have More Fun

            When you homeschool your children, you get to learn and play with your kids. You go on all the field trips with
            them, you read the same books, and you get to do the same fun art projects. This degree of involvement is much 
            more engaging for parents and children alike, and it really accelerates the learning process.
            
            2. We're Closer as a Family

            When you cultivate an environment of trust, encouragement, curiosity, and creativity in your home classroom, your
            children will be much less likely to become the stereotypical rebellious, angry teenagers that you hear about all
            the time. That angry rebellion is often the product of a repressive educational system which squashes creative
            thought and curiosity, and leaves children feeling frustrated and powerless. Many parents of homeschool teenagers 
            report that their children grow to become independent and responsible young adults without that dark, reckless 
            rebelliousness ever coming between them. As a result, their families enjoy close, loving, and supportive relationships.
            
            3. You Learn As Much As Your Kids Do

            They say the best way to learn is through teaching, and homeschooling certainly supports that claim. Most of us have 
            some gaps from our time in school, especially if it's been quite a long time since we learned about a subject. 
            Homeschooling is a great way to explore a subject together with your children.Rather than the typical rote learning 
            approach, homeschooling gives you the opportunity to learn about the spirit of a subject, to discuss the most interesting 
            aspects of it, and to explore the practical usefulness of it. This is much more effective education than memorizing and
            regurgitating dates and formulas,for you as well as your children.
