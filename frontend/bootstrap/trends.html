        <pre style="font-weight: bold;">
            NEW DELHI: As UK foreign secretary Elizabeth Truss looked on, foreign minister S Jaishankar hit out at what he called a campaign against India
            on the issue of its oil imports from Russia saying Europe continued to be a major buyer of Russia energy and that it’s natural for countries to 
            look for 'good deals' in the market when oil prices go up.

            Jaishankar and Truss were addressing the first India-UK Strategic Futures Forum on Thursday evening, shortly after the arrival of Russian foreign minister
            Sergey Lavrov in Delhi. Lavrov will hold a meeting with Jaishankar on Friday and also brief PM Narendra Modi about Russia’s position on Ukraine.
